# The powers layer

Matters when touching powers.

Working notes for MM-Companion, split out of [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md).

Powers are the most complex part, and are split the same core/data/ui way. Read
`docs/mm-powers-architecture.md` for the full model; the shape:

- There is **no fixed catalog of powers** — a player assembles a
  `core.powers.Power` (a titled, described bundle) out of parts: one or more
  `PowerEffectInstance` (a base `Effect` from `effects.json` at a chosen rank),
  each carrying its own `ModifierSelection` extras and flaws (referencing
  `modifiers.json` / `effect_modifiers.json`). This is plain, JSON-serializable
  data (`to_dict`/`from_dict`); it holds no costs — those are derived in `rules`.
- A multi-effect power has a `structure` (`independent`, `linked`, or `array`).
  The structure is the source of truth, **not** per-effect modifier chips:
  independent and linked sum their effects' costs (linked is a +0 bundle), an
  array pays the costliest effect in full plus a flat point per alternate. Cost
  math and the game-terms summary read `structure` to decide.
- `core.components.py` is an ECS-style split: effect *instances* are entities;
  the frozen **components** describing behaviour are the base effect's parsed
  `Integration` (a `statIntegration` `pattern` — `passive_permanent`,
  `passive_toggle`, `instant_action`, `resource_pool` — plus an optional
  `TraitBoost` for Enhanced-Trait / Protection), and per-instance **gate kinds**
  derived from a flaw's `gate` tag (`activation`, `removable`, `toggle`,
  `limited`). The *systems* reading these — `effect_is_active`,
  `power_trait_bonuses`, `effective_ability`, … — live in `rules`.
- **Cost** (`rules`): `effect_total_cost` = `ceil` of net per-rank cost × rank
  (with M&M's sub-1-PP/rank fraction rule) plus flat modifiers; `power_total_cost`
  folds in the structure. `effect_cost_formula` renders the human-readable
  breakdown. All numbers are data-driven (`base_cost_value`, modifier
  `cost_value`, config `cost_value` overrides) — never hardcoded.
- **Effective vs. bought**: `effect_effective_rank` adds an ability a modifier
  folds in (Strength-Based Damage → Strength) to the bought rank — this is the
  rank that sets save DCs and PL caps, while cost counts only the bought rank.
  A power's active `TraitBoost` feeds `effective_ability` / `resistance_total` /
  `skill_total`, so an Enhanced-Trait boost flows through the whole sheet; the
  power pays for it, so the boosted trait's own point cost is unchanged.
- **Runtime state** (separate from the point build): `effect.toggled_on` /
  `effect.suppressed` and `power.activated` / `power.item_present` gate whether a
  passive bonus currently applies (`effect_is_active`). The UI drives all of a
  power's gates from one "Active" switch.
- **Runtime is saved.** It used to be the other way round — every runtime flag was
  left out of `to_dict()` on the argument that what is switched on is not part of the
  build — and the size ladder is what broke it: a Growth 3 *held* at Large is a
  standing decision about the character that four of the sheet's numbers hang off,
  and reopening the file at Gargantuan silently changed them. So
  `activated`/`item_present`/`array_active`, `PowerGroup.active_child_id` and each
  effect's `toggled_on`/`suppressed`/`current_rank` all round-trip now. Four things
  make that additive rather than a migration. Each is **written only when it differs
  from the all-active default**, so a power nobody has touched serializes
  byte-for-byte as before and a file saved earlier still loads all-active — there is
  no schema version and no reader that needs one. It is still not **cost**: nothing
  here is a term in `power_total_cost`, and dialling a Growth down refunds nothing.
  `capture_runtime`/`apply_runtime` shed the powers half entirely (the snapshot
  carries it), which is what makes a runtime toggle an ordinary undoable step instead
  of a change `restore` had to hold over. And the Powers block's `runtimeChanged`
  gained `EDITED` on the bus: a state that is saved but never marks the sheet dirty
  shows no `*`, prompts nothing on close, and is lost — the exact bug again, one
  layer up. **Equipment's `worn` is deliberately not part of this** (see [The equipment layer](equipment.md)): what is in your hands this round is not what your powers are set
  to.
- **Game-term summary**: `effect_stat_rows` / `effect_game_terms` /
  `power_game_terms` render each effect's Type/Range/Action/Duration/Check/
  Resistance with modifier and config overrides applied, tinting a field an extra
  improved (better) or a flaw limited (worse), resolving check/DC phrases to real
  numbers, and appending measures, configured qualities, trait-boost lines, and
  the Tier-5 `effect_readout_rows`.
- **Validation** (warnings for now): `power_pl_violations` (per-power attack +
  effect-rank / auto-hit rank caps, read against the wielder),
  `power_allocation_violations` (a Tier-4 effect over-spending its rank pool),
  and `power_linked_range_violations`. Whether a PL breach merely warns or blocks
  the save is the single app-wide seam `core.storage.pl_enforcement()`
  (`"warn"` / `"block"`), so it can become a settings toggle later.
- **UI**: `PowersSection` ("Add Power") launches the standalone
  `ui/power_constructor/window.py::PowerConstructorWindow` — a drag-and-drop
  brick-builder (a palette of Effect/Extra/Flaw bricks → an effect-card canvas,
  a `PowerModeBar` for the structure once ≥2 effects). It hands the finished
  `Power` back via `powerSaved`; the section appends it to the shared `Character`
  and renders a stat-block **card** (header with cost and ⚠ PL-breach marker;
  description; per effect, its extras/flaws in a column *beside* that effect's
  full game-term table, always visible, in small muted type; then a dice footer).
  The footer lists **one roll per line** (`_rolls_lines` — an attack check and the
  save it forces are separate rolls), and a power that rolls nothing gets no
  footer and no rule above it rather than a "nothing to roll" placeholder. Cards
  carry edit (reopens the constructor on a deep copy, replaced in place on save)
  and remove buttons. The constructor always gets costs from `rules`, never inline.
- The **card is the on/off switch** — there is no "Active" checkbox. Clicking a
  card's body toggles a runtime-gated power, flips a Linked group (from its group
  card), or picks an array's live alternate; `_activation_role(node, parent)`
  decides which, `""` meaning "not clickable — let the click bubble to the
  enclosing card", which is how a Linked group's members are driven by their
  group. A switched-off card *shows* it: dimmed (`QGraphicsOpacityEffect`) and a
  notch smaller, never `setEnabled(False)` (which would kill the click and grey
  the text out). That look is a **continuous** quantity —
  `_DraggableCard.set_off_progress(0..1)` interpolates opacity, type size and
  padding together — so a flip *eases* over `PowersSection.TRANSITION_MS` instead
  of cutting. Every runtime setter ends in `_rebuild_list()` (flipping one power
  can restate another card's numbers), so no card survives a toggle: the section
  instead remembers each node's on-screen progress in `_card_off` and the
  replacement card eases on from there, the running animation writing that
  progress back per frame so an interrupted flip resumes rather than snaps. Tests
  zero `TRANSITION_MS` via an autouse fixture in `tests/conftest.py`. A clickable
  card also advertises itself — a standing accent left edge, plus an accent border
  on hover (`_DraggableCard._restyle`); an inert card stays flat. Only a **leaf**
  card adds a background wash: a stylesheet background paints behind every child,
  so a filled group card would flood its whole subtree. And **exactly one card is
  lit at a time** — Qt sends no Leave to a widget the pointer merely moved deeper
  into, so `enterEvent` stands every enclosing card down and `leaveEvent` hands the
  highlight back to an ancestor still under the cursor (read from `QCursor.pos()`,
  not `underMouse()`, whose flag is already stale by then). Any
  label with an explicit size must set it on its `QFont`, **not** in a stylesheet:
  a stylesheet `font-size` outranks the card's font and would sit the transition
  out. Runtime toggling stays available in the locked read-only view — it is a
  mid-play action, not a build edit, so it emits `runtimeChanged`, not `changed`
  (which still marks the sheet unwritten, since the state is saved).
